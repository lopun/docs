# Test Template

With a created template on the previous page, now you can test an actual API with the created template.

### Step 1: Generate Demo Data with GPT-3.5

Start by describing the demo data that you want to create.

1. Add the columns you'll use.
2. Add a description about what kind of data this table has, and which formula (e.g., sum, average, etc.) to use for each column.

**Example:**

Columns
: UserName, Age, Paid Status, Paid Amount

Description
: This table has user data and payment data. The 'Paid amount' column's formula should be 'SUM', 'Age' column's formula should be 'Average'.

When you have entered all columns and a description for each table, click the "AUTO-GENERATE SAMPLE REQUEST" button. Please wait for about 5-10 seconds until test data generation is completed.

### Step 2: Test API

Now that you have the test data, you can test the API. Modify the JSON request body and click the "TEST API" button. You can set the table data, column name/formula/filter, export options(password, expireInDays, filename), template variables, template_id, custom data area, transform(styling, cell merge). Experiment with the following presets:

- üê• Essential Data Only
- üóÉÔ∏è Change Filename
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Change Sheet Names
- ‚úÖ Set Direct Data (e.g., E5)
- üîê Set Password
- ‚è∞ Set Download Expiration Day
- üöÄ Set All Options

### Step 3: Ready-to-Use Code Snippet

After you have thoroughly tested the data in Step 2, you can copy and paste the generated code into your preferred programming language.

Currently, we offer a Node.js SDK but we plan to provide SDKs for multiple programming languages, including Python, Java/Kotlin, Go, and more.

<Info>
  If your language does not have an SDK, you can call the API directly. (Check
  out cURL code instead)
