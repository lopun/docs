## Introducing Sheetah — A Cheetah-fast Excel Export API

Sheetah, built especially for developers, turns the often complex and time-consuming task of Excel exports into a swift, simple process.

Sheetah employs a template-based process that covers everything from creating an Excel template to downloading the final file. All in one streamlined platform with features like template design, variable customization, styling, cell merging, and even AI-powered test data generation.

## Our Mission: Simplify Excel Export Process

We've experienced first-hand the challenges of Excel export, with time-consuming tasks such as Excel styling, writing client/server code, and managing cloud storage uploads. This challenge was particularly significant when implementing Excel export for our own e-commerce platform.

That's when we realized there had to be a better way — and Sheetah was born. It's the software solution we wish we had: an intuitive and quick tool for all your Excel export needs.
